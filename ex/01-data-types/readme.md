# What is type?

JavaScript is a _dynamically typed_ language. What this means, is when a variable is declared you do not have to tell the computer what _type_ will be stored inside of it, JavaScript will _dynamically_ determine this.

## Types in JS
There are six different _primitive_ types in JavaScript. A _primitive_ type is simply a stored value. _Non-primitive_ types like Object or Array store data in more complex structures and offer additional functionality, like [Array.keys()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/keys)

## Primitive Types
The six primitive types in JavaScript are as follows;
```
        boolean
        string
        number
        symbol
        null
        undefined
```
### Boolean
Booleans store true/false. They can be combined to form complex Boolean statements.
```
    true and true === true
    true and false === false
    false and false === false

    
    true or true === true
    true or false === true
    false or false === false
```

### String
Strings in Javascript are denoted by quotation marks, either double ("") or single ('') work, just be **consistent** in what you choose to use.
```    
    'this is a string'
    "this is also a string"
```

### Number
Numbers in JavaScript are exactly what they sound like; numbers used for calculations. There is only one numeric type in JavaScript.
```
    1
    2
    3
```
### Symbol
Symbols were introduced in ES6. If you are interested in learning more about them you can do so [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol).

### Null
Null is a value of nothing. this differs from _undefined_ because a null value _has_ been set, but it has been set to _nothing_.
```
    let example = null
```
### Undefined
Undefined is returned when the value you are accessing has not been defined. This is commonly returned when there is a typo in what property you are accessing the object at.
```
    const myObject = { someKey : someValue}

    myObject.ssmeKey === someValue //false
    myObject.ssmeKey === undefined //true
```
## Non-Primitive Types
Non-Primitive types are used to combine and handle data in more complex ways. The ones you will encounter most often are arrays and objects.

### Arrays
Arrays are an _iterable_ type. What this means is they can be _iterated_ over in order. Information stored in an array is stored specifically in the order it is created in. Arrays can also be nested. Arrays can hold values of _any_ type, but you should only store data of one type in an array.
```
    ['This', 'is', 'an', 'array']
    [['nested','values']['an','array','of','arrays']]
    [1,2,3]
    [[1,1],[1,2],[1,3]]
```
#### Accessing Array Data
Arrays are accessed or _indexed_ using bracket notation. The index of an array starts at zero, so to access an array you use square brackets to get the value of the passed index ex. 
```    
    syntax: array[index]

    let exampleArray = [0,1,2,3]

    exampleArray[0] === 0 //true
    exampleArray[3] === 3 //true
    exampleArray[4] === undefined //true
```
### Objects
Objects are a data structure used to _store information_. They are made up of a series of _keys_ and _values_. They are __not iterable__. You can access an object via bracket notation _or_ dot notation. Information stored on an object is called a _property_. Functions on an object are also known as _methods_. Data of any type can be stored on an object.
```
    syntax: { key:value }

    const myObj = {
        someProperty : 'someValue'
        someMethod : function()
        { 
            //do something 
        }
    }

    myObj[someProperty] === 'someValue' //true
    myObj.someProperty === 'someValue' //true
```
